###################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only the most common
# options. The filebeat.full.yml file from the same directory contains all the
# supported options with more comments. You can use it as a reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html

#=========================== Filebeat prospectors =============================

filebeat.prospectors:

# Each - is a prospector. Most options can be set at the prospector level, so
# you can use different prospectors for various configurations.
# Below are the prospector specific configurations.

- input_type: log

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  paths:
    - ${FILEBEAT_PATHS:/data/www/storage/logs/*.log}
    #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

  # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list.
  #exclude_lines: ["^DBG"]

  # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list.
  #include_lines: ["^ERR", "^WARN"]

  # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
  # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
  #exclude_files: [".gz$"]

  # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
  # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
  #fields:
  #  level: debug
  #  review: 1
  document_type: monlog
  ### Multiline options

  # Mutiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
  # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  multiline.pattern: ^\[

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  multiline.negate: true

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  multiline.match: after


#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
name: ${FILEBEAT_NAME:micro-service}

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.


#------------------------------- Redis output ----------------------------------
output.redis:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: ${FILEBEAT_REDIS_ENABLED:false}

  # The list of Redis servers to connect to. If load balancing is enabled, the
  # events are distributed to the servers in the list. If one server becomes
  # unreachable, the events are distributed to the reachable servers only.
  hosts: ["${FILEBEAT_REDIS_HOST:127.0.0.1}:${FILEBEAT_REDIS_PORT:6379}"]

  # The Redis port to use if hosts does not contain a port number. The default
  # is 6379.
  port: ${FILEBEAT_REDIS_PORT:6379}

  # The name of the Redis list or channel the events are published to. The
  # default is filebeat.
  key: ${FILEBEAT_REDIS_KEY:logstash-micro-service}

  # The password to authenticate with. The default is no authentication.
  password: ${FILEBEAT_REDIS_PASSWORD:}

  # The Redis database number where the events are published. The default is 0.
  db: ${FILEBEAT_REDIS_DB:0}

  # The Redis data type to use for publishing events. If the data type is list,
  # the Redis RPUSH command is used. If the data type is channel, the Redis
  # PUBLISH command is used. The default value is list.
  datatype: list

  # The number of workers to use for each host configured to publish events to
  # Redis. Use this setting along with the loadbalance option. For example, if
  # you have 2 hosts and 3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each
  # host).
  worker: ${FILEBEAT_REDIS_WORKER:1}

  # If set to true and multiple hosts or workers are configured, the output
  # plugin load balances published events onto all Redis hosts. If set to false,
  # the output plugin sends all events to only one host (determined at random)
  # and will switch to another host if the currently selected one becomes
  # unreachable. The default value is true.
  #loadbalance: true

  # The Redis connection timeout in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
  timeout: 5s

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
  # After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
  # Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the max_retries setting and retry until
  # all events are published. Set max_retries to a value less than 0 to retry
  # until all events are published. The default is 3.
  #max_retries: 3

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Redis request or pipeline.
  # The default is 2048.
  #bulk_max_size: 2048

  # The URL of the SOCKS5 proxy to use when connecting to the Redis servers. The
  # value must be a URL with a scheme of socks5://.
  #proxy_url:

  # This option determines whether Redis hostnames are resolved locally when
  # using a proxy. The default value is false, which means that name resolution
  # occurs on the proxy server.
  #proxy_use_local_resolver: false

  # Enable SSL support. SSL is automatically enabled, if any SSL setting is set.
  #ssl.enabled: true

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
  # and certificates will be accepted. In this mode, SSL based connections are
  # susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing. Default is
  # `full`.
  #ssl.verification_mode: full

  # List of supported/valid TLS versions. By default all TLS versions 1.0 up to
  # 1.2 are enabled.
  #ssl.supported_protocols: [TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]

  # Optional SSL configuration options. SSL is off by default.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

  # Optional passphrase for decrypting the Certificate Key.
  #ssl.key_passphrase: ''

  # Configure cipher suites to be used for SSL connections
  #ssl.cipher_suites: []

  # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites
  #ssl.curve_types: []

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]
